# PicoCTF Reverse Engineering Challenges

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions to the reverse engineering challenges from the PicoCTF Gym. My primary tool for tackling these challenges is [angr](https://angr.io/), a powerful binary analysis framework.

## Setup
To get started with these challenges and angr, you'll need the following:

1. **Python 3.6+**
2. **angr**: Install via pip
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv angr
    ```
    ```sh
    source angr/bin/activate
    ```
    ```sh
    pip install angr
    pip install ipython
    ```
